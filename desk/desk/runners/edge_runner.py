"""Run Edge Desk on one ticker and write its report as JSON.

Executed by the desk with Edge Desk's own interpreter:
    <EdgeDesk>\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe edge_runner.py TICKER YYYY-MM-DD OUT.json

Edge Desk is used as it is: the deterministic run (evidence, factors, rating, levels), then its
written analysis (four lenses, independent bull and bear, synthesis), which already runs on the
Max plan through its own headless caller. The run is also saved in ~/.edge-desk/runs as usual.

What the desk needs from it:
    rating          the long-term rating, or None when Edge withheld it (then it does not vote)
    swing           the swing call (Buy or Sell, with its plan). Edge does not VOTE on swing: its call was measured
                    so it never votes on the swing horizon; the setup is evidence for the others
    report_md       the full report, which is what the other managers argue against
    steps           one entry per stage, for the dashboard's agent list
