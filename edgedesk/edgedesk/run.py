"""One analysis run, start to finish, and the JSON file that is its record.

The run file is the source of truth. Reports render from it, the next week's
run compares against it, and the LLM layer (Phase D) annotates it without ever
changing a number in it. There is no database: a run is a file, and the file is
complete enough to rebuild every view from.

Reproducibility is enforced, not hoped for. Everything the rating depends on is
hashed, and the hash excludes only the wall-clock stamps, so the same ticker at
the same as-of date twice must produce the same `content_hash`. If it does not,
something non-deterministic got into the path and the test suite says so.
