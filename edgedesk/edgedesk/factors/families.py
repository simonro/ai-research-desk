"""The eight factor families.

Each family reads the evidence package, scores the signals it can compute, and
abstains on the ones it cannot. Every signal records the fact id it came from,
so a number in any report can be traced back to a source and a timestamp.

Two conventions hold everywhere:

* **Higher is better**, in every family except `risk`, where higher always means
  more risk. The two GitHub projects both had a "risk score" that pointed one
  way in one place and the other way somewhere else; naming the direction once
  and never breaking it is worth more than any extra factor.
* **Coverage is reported, not hidden.** A family says how much of itself it was
  able to compute. A score built from a fraction of its inputs is still a score,
  but the verdict layer is told how thin it is.

FACTORS_VERSION changes whenever a curve or a weight changes, so a stored run
always says which formula produced it. A rating from v1 and a rating from v2 are
not the same measurement and the run files must never pretend otherwise.
