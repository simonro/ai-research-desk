"""The canonical evidence package: everything one run is allowed to know.

This is the layer the two GitHub projects do not have. There, each engine
fetched its own numbers, so a disagreement could be a difference of judgement
or simply a difference of data, and nobody could tell which. Here every factor,
every level and every sentence the LLM later writes reads from one package,
built once for `(ticker, as_of)`, where each figure carries an id, a source and
the date it is true as of.

Three rules hold the whole thing up:

* **Point in time.** Fundamentals are keyed to SEC filing date, prices stop at
  the last settled close, and nothing current is applied to a historical as_of.
  Consensus is fetched today and is therefore stamped current-only: it is
  excluded outright when the run is historical.
* **Missing is missing.** A figure that cannot be computed is None and its
  factor abstains. It never becomes a zero, and it never becomes a neutral
  score, because a neutral score is an opinion nobody formed.
* **Caveats are graded.** Every data problem carries a severity, and the
  verdict layer turns severities into VALID / DEGRADED / WITHHELD.
