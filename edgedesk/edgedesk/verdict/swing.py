"""The swing call: Buy or Sell, the plan if it is a Buy, and how it was reached.

The user decides whether to take the trade. This module's job is to put a call in
front of him with every reason attached and its evidence standing stated, so the
judgement is his and informed.

What the call is built from, and why these weights. The research in
docs/SWING-EVIDENCE-2026-09.md tested 46 chart readings and four pattern setups on
229 names over 2019 to 2026. Classic trend and momentum readings did not predict
the next 1 to 13 weeks; buying weakness inside long-term strength was the one
direction that held in both samples; a strong earnings reaction was followed by
underperformance; tight one-candle stops were taken out by noise; fixed R targets
lowered expectancy. The call follows that evidence where it exists, and where it
does not (sentiment, fundamentals at this horizon) the component is included at a
modest weight and labelled untested, because a reader wants it and the honest
label costs nothing.

  setup (30)         which of five recognised setups is live, in its long-term context
  momentum (20)      12-1 and 6-month return, strength against the sector, accumulation
  earnings (10)      last reaction INVERTED, the surprise, earnings growth
  revisions (10)     how next year's EPS estimate has moved in 30 and 90 days, and how
                     many analysts raised against how many cut
  fundamentals (10)  the quality, growth and valuation families
  sentiment (15)     Street upside, target changes, headline tone
  opportunity (5)    volatility: more range, more to capture, more risk

Version 2.1 (2026-09-20) follows the author's direction: momentum carries more weight, and
a Buy can come from any of five setups, not only a pullback: a deep dip, a dip the
buyers have visibly taken back, a leader under accumulation, a breakout from a coiled
range, or a slide of 3 ATR from the high. Each was run as a full trade plan on 229
names first, and its record is printed beside it, because three of the five did not
beat buying on a random day and the reader is the one who decides.

Score = 50 + half the weighted sum of component readings in [-1, +1]. Buy at 60 or
above with no blocker AND at least one live setup; otherwise Sell. Most names are a
Sell on most days, which is what a selective swing call should look like. For a long-only book Sell means do not buy,
and exit or tighten if held.

The plan comes from the chart, in the order a swing trader works: invalidation
first (a real structural level 1.5 to 3 ATR away, or 2 ATR if there is none),
then shares from the dollar risk, then targets from structure.
