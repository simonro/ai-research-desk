"""From factor families to a rating, by an explicit rule.

The rating is arithmetic, not judgement. A horizon is a set of weights over the
families; the weighted score falls in a band; the band is the rating. Written
down like this, a disagreement becomes a disagreement about a weight or a
breakpoint, which is a conversation worth having, instead of a disagreement
about what a model felt, which is not.

Three deliberate choices:

* **Risk is not in the sum.** Folding risk into the score makes a risky good
  business and a safe mediocre one indistinguishable. Risk shapes conviction
  and the levels instead, and it is always reported in its own direction.
* **The horizons are separate questions**, not one score read twice. A broken
  chart matters over six weeks and is noise over five years, so the weights
  differ and the two ratings are allowed to disagree.
* **Coverage can withhold the rating.** If too much of the weighted evidence is
  missing, the honest output is no rating, not a confident-looking number built
  from whatever happened to be available.

RATING_VERSION changes whenever a weight or a band moves. The bands here are
uncalibrated starting values: Phase C measures whether higher bands actually
produce better forward outcomes and moves them on evidence, and until it has,
every report says so.
