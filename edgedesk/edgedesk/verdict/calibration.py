"""What the calibration actually found, recorded where the reports can see it.

A rating that has been measured and a rating that has not are different claims,
and a reader cannot tell them apart from the number. So the findings live here,
stamped with the versions they were measured against, and every report prints
the standing of the rating it is showing.

This is updated by hand after a calibration run, deliberately. Wiring the
report to the last calibration's output would mean a thin or broken run could
silently upgrade a rating's standing, and "the computer says it is validated
now" is exactly the claim that should need a person behind it.

Findings are invalidated by a change to the formula OR to the factors under it.
A rating is a function of both, so a finding about rating 1.0.0 on factors 1.0.0
says nothing about rating 1.0.0 on factors 1.1.0. When either version moves, the
reports say the standing is unknown and quote the old finding only as history.

The words are chosen with care. "Validated" is reserved for a result that held on
data the rules never saw, across enough distinct companies that one of them
cannot carry it. Nothing here has met that bar yet, so nothing here uses the word.
